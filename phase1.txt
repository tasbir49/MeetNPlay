MARK AS LATE


Our web app is a meetup app for local multiplayer games.
Users can make posts saying they want to host a meetup.

User Instructions:
    Go to top right and select make post to create meetup post
    
    Go to post listing to request an invite to a meetup
    if your invite is accepted, a link to view the post will appear. If you made the post, or are an admin, you can view the post anyways
    You can filter meetup posts on the right side (this does nothing for now).
    You can report inappropriate posts on the page
    
    You can view the detailed page of a meetup post you created or are invited to.
    Users who made a post can edit the info, and invite other users, or delete the post.
        To delete click on the three vertical dots on the right
    inviting and leaving a post do nothing so far
        
    3 dot options also let you view other profiles
    you can view your own on the circle on the top right
    
    On the top you can go to home page or go to top of page.
    On the top right, clicking the circle brings out a menu that lets you make a post, view your profile or logout
    You can edit the info on your own account EXCEPT for the Member Since field
    Can change password(this does nothing without backend).
    You can report other inappropriate users for any reason
    
    can make a post using the menu on the top right
    submitting does nothing so far
    

Admin Instructions:
